name: XIMEA Camera Device
signature: iodevice/ximea_camera
isa: IODevice
platform: macos
description: |
    Interface to a `XIMEA <https://www.ximea.com/>`_ camera.

    MWorks configures the camera to capture 8-bit, grayscale images.  Each frame
    capture is triggered by MWorks (i.e. software triggering).  In addition, the
    output pin on the camera (OUT1 if there are multiple outputs) is configured
    to be on during frame exposure.

    Multiple cameras can be connected and used simultaneously, as long as
    `serial_number`_ is specified for each device.
parameters: 
  - 
    name: serial_number
    example: 12345678
    description: |
        Serial number of the desired camera.

        If only one camera is connected, this parameter can be omitted, and
        MWorks will connect to the one available device.
  - 
    name: exposure_time
    required: yes
    example: 2ms
    description: >
        Exposure time for each captured frame.  Must be greater than zero.
  - 
    name: capture_interval
    required: yes
    example: 33.33ms
    description: >
        Interval between frame captures.  Must be greater than zero.
  - 
    name: image_data
    required: yes
    description: |
        Variable in which to store captured frames.

        The value assigned to the variable is a binary string containing a `JPEG
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG>`_-encoded image.  The time stamp of
        the assignment is taken immediately after MWorks triggers the frame
        capture.
